                <p>We are conducting an academic study&nbsp;about Graph Visualizations. 
                    We need to understand your views about a graph visualization by performing a couple of graph tasks. 
                    Copy and paste the&nbsp;link below in a new window&nbsp;to complete the graph visualization study.&nbsp; At the end of the study, you will receive a code to paste into the box below to receive credit for taking our study. Thank you.</p>
